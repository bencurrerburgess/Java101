<h1>Assignment: DB</h1>

<p>This assignment counts for 40% of the unit, and there are three weeks to do
it in.</p>

<p>The main aim of the assignment is to gain experience of incremental
development, including refactoring as well as unit testing.  As well as your
program, you should submit a report which describes the stages of development,
the design decisions you made, any refactoring you had to do, and any
particularly interesting issues that arose during implementation.  In order to
explain your progress, you might want to include zipped up copies of your code
at each stage of development.  In fact, if you want, you can submit each stage
with its own mini report as you complete it.</p>

<p>This description deliberately describes more stages of development than you
are likely to be able to carry out.  And later stages are deliberately
described with less and less detail, to allow for you to go in your own chosen
direction.  There is no one "correct" or "best" design here - there is a huge
number of possibilites (though, of course, some designs are better than
others).</p>

<p>It is important that you finish some well-polished and robust stages that
you feel proud of, rather than racing ahead to try to get as many done as
possible in a very rough way.  And try to increase the breadth of your
experience a bit, maybe practicing things that have been mentioned in feedback
from previous assignments, or trying out new tools and techniques.</p>

<h2>The idea</h2>

<p>The idea is to design and implement a home-made database system.  Some
suggestions will be given for the first few stages of development, and then
after that, a number of extensions will be outlined for the adventurous.  I
suggest not even reading about a stage until you have finished the previous
ones, so that each stage comes as a change of requirements.  As you finish each
stage, you might want to keep a snapshot of it, to make it easier to produce a
report at the end.</p>

<p>Please don't try to do everything - just work steadily, make sure each stage
is clean and robust, and stop when you run out of time.</p>

<h2>Records</h2>

<p>The first suggested stage is to sort out how to store
individual <dfn>records</dfn>, also called <dfn>rows</dfn> or <dfn>tuples</dfn>
or <dfn>objects</dfn>.  A record contains named <dfn>fields</dfn>, also
called <dfn>entries</dfn> or <dfn>values</dfn> or <dfn>cells</dfn>
or <dfn>items</dfn>.  For example, suppose you have a table of animals and a
table of people like this:</p>

<table style="float:left" class="indent"><tbody>
<tr><th>Id</th><th>Name</th><th>Kind</th><th>Owner</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Fido</td><td>dog</td><td>ab123</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Wanda</td><td>fish</td><td>ef789</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Garfield</td><td>cat</td><td>ab123</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<table style="float:left" class="indent"><tbody>
<tr><th>Username</th><th>Name</th></tr>
<tr><td>ab123</td><td>Jo</td></tr>
<tr><td>cd456</td><td>Sam</td></tr>
<tr><td>ef789</td><td>Amy</td></tr>
<tr><td>gh012</td><td>Pete</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p style="clear:both">The first contains three records and the second contains
four.  The animals table has fields called "id", "Name", "Kind", "Owner".  The
people table has fields "Username", "Name".</p>

<p>The idea behind this stage of development is that you develop a single
general-purpose class called <code>Record</code> (or whatever you want) which
will hold any type of record, no matter what table it is from, as a collection
of fields which are strings. The operations on a record object are, perhaps, to
find out how many strings it has, and to get or set individual strings.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you ignore the field names for now, and just store the
string values in a specific order.  In other words, a record is hardly any more
than an array of strings. The <code>Record</code> class is just a place to
gather code later as development continues.  Alternatively, you could store the
field names in a record, but with a view to sharing them between all the
records of one table later, so you don;t store the same data multiple
times.</p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>The second stage is to deal with <dfn>tables</dfn>, also
called <dfn>relations</dfn> or <dfn>types</dfn>.  A table is a collection of
records, all having the same number of fields, in the same order, with the same
names.</p>

<p>Again, the aim is to design a single general-purpose class,
say <code>Table</code>, to hold any table.  At this point, you may want a table
object to hold the field names, rather than repeating them in every record
object.  In that case, the fields are often called <dfn>columns</dfn>
or <dfn>attributes</dfn> or <dfn>properties</dfn>.</p>

<p>Common operations on a table which you might want to make convenient or
efficient are to <em>select</em> a record (perhaps by row
number), <em>insert</em> a record, <em>delete</em> a record, or <em>update</em>
a record.  You might also give a little thought to doing these operations on
multiple records at the same time.</p>

<p>Less frequent operations, which don't need to be so convenient or efficient,
might be to <em>create</em> a table with given column names, or <em>alter</em>
a table, e.g. by adding an extra column.</p>

<p>Depending on your approach and attitude, you may find a potential problem at
this point, because it seems that a table needs to know about the records in
it, and a record seems to need to know what table it is in (so that it knows
what field names it has).  There are several ways to resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>In this stage, the data for each table can be stored in its own file.  The
file holds (say) a first line which acts as a header of column names, and one
line for each records.  You might want to use readable text files.  In that
case, you might use an ordinary character such as a comma between fields, and a
newline as a record terminator.  But then you need some mechanism to allow
commas and newlines in field values.  Alternatively, you could use a format
where suitable control characters are used to separate fields and terminate
records, while insisting that only readable non-control characters are allowed
in fields.</p>

<p>The record and table classes now have to be adapted to allow for loading up
their data from files, and writing their data back to files.  You may want to
assume, at this stage, that writing back to files is done just once when the
overall driving program shuts down, rather than bit by bit as changes are
made.</p>

<p>There are alternative file storage possibilites that you might want to
investigate either now, or as a later stage of development.</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>

<p>At this stage, there should be a way to print out a table neatly, preferably
with the columns lining up.</p>

<h2>Keys</h2>

<p>A key is a unique identifier of some sort for each record of a table.
Either the key can be something separate, or it can simply be assumed to be the
first field and handled more-or-less the same as the other fields (either
approach can work well).  Also, the key can be automatically generated, or the
user might be responsible for it in the same way as any other field (either
approach works).</p>

<p>Changes to the classes already developed might include making sure that keys
are unique, i.e. that there can't be two records with the same key in the same
table.  Some thought, and possibly refactoring, may be required to find the
best way to guarantee this kind of consistency property.</p>

<p>Keys can now be used to provide a more stable way of referring to records,
rather than using row numbers - the row number of a record changes as other
records are inserted or deleted, but the key doesn't change.  So, in the
animals and people example above, the "Owner" field in an animal record holds
the key (username) of its owner.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>A database is a collection of related tables, each with its own name.  What
is needed is some way of wrapping up this idea, perhaps with a database class
and some conventions for a database folder.</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>The stages described from this point on are extensions.  Please feel free to
stop at this point, or to choose which extensions you want to concentrate on,
or to change their order, or to go in a completely different direction of your
own.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>Each column in a table can be given a type.  Values can still be stored as
strings, but the type controls what strings are allowed and how they are
handled.  Alternatively, values of different types can be stored in different
ways, but wrapped so as to make fields of different types compatible.</p>

<p>As an example, a column of type <code>integer</code> might restrict strings
in fields to digits, and cause printing to be done with right-alignment.
Another possibility is a tag type, where each field can only hold one of a
short enumerated list of values.  Most importantly, a reference type is needed,
representing a "foreign key" field, i.e. a field which refers to a record in
another table by its key.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>Once you have foreign key fields, there is the question of how you make sure
that such fields always refer to other records which actually exist.
Automatically checked constriants are one of the strengths of database
systems.</p>

<h2>Catalogs</h2>

<p>Some mechanism might be needed to access meta-information about a database,
such as a list of tables, the types of their columns, and so on, and some way
of querying this information perhaps in the same way as querying ordinary
records.</p>

<h2>Query language</h2>

<p>A textual language could be added for querying a database.  The SQL language
is standard, but dreadful, for a variety of reasons.  You might prefer to try
implementing some cleaner, after reading this:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="/software/sql/">SQL notes</a></p>

<h2>Transactions</h2>

<p>A transaction is a series of queries treated as an atomic unit, i.e. if
anything goes wrong, the database is kept in or restored to the same state as
before the queries were started.</p>

<h2>Journals</h2>

<p>A journal is one way in which changes to the data can be stored as you go
along, in a way which is very robust.  If the program or computer crashes, the
database can be restored to a safe, consistent and recent state.</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>A full textual user interface, or even a graphical one, could be added.</p>
