<h1>Assignment: Graphics</h1>

<p>This assignment counts for 40% of the unit, and late submission results in
mark penalties.</p>

<p>The aim of this assignment is to get to grips with Java's graphics library
facilities, to demonstrate the design and programming skills which you have
acquired from the course, and to show off some creativity.</p>

<p>Your task is to create any Java program you like which has a graphical user
interface, and shows off Java's graphics facilities in some way.  I expect most
of you to use JavaFX, but if you want to use Swing (e.g. because JavaFX isn't
avaliable in the lab) that's OK, and I've posted last year's Swing-based
lecture notes to help.  Your program could be a pet project you've wanted to
have a go at for some time, or it could be a game or other interesting or
useful application.  It is deliberately completely open ended, to give you
creative freedom.</p>

<p>Since Java's graphics facilities are extensive, you are not expected to
cover them all.  You may want to concentrate on the layout of a conventional
graphical user interface using widgets such as buttons and menus and so on.
Alternatively, you may want to concentrate on drawing issues such as sketching
or drag-and-drop.  Or perhaps you could investigate the support for handling or
manipulating images.  If your interests are in the area of user interaction,
then a game might suit you well.  Or if you have strong non-graphical
interests, you may want to concentrate on developing something interesting
where the graphical interface is relatively incidental and simple.  If you want
to experiment with libraries beyond the standard ones (e.g. 3-D) or if you want
to write an Android app to gain experience in that area, that's OK too, but
please avoid web applets since they are essentially obsolete now.</p>

<p>You can name your program anything you want, but I don't recommend calling
it <code>Graphics.java</code> because that is likely to clash with
the <code>Graphics</code> library class (at least if you are using Swing).  You
can either take on something relatively simple and polish it well, or try
something more ambitious and submit a proof-of-concept prototype.  If you
produce a normal application, packaging it as an executable jar file would be
convenient.  In any case, it is a good idea to submit a zip or jar file with
all the source code and resources such as images in it, plus instructions or
a <code>make</code> or <code>ant</code> file to tell me how to build and run
the program.</p>

<p>As well as the program, you should produce a report (<code>report.pdf</code>
or <code>report.txt</code> or <code>report.html</code>) which explains the
design of your program, tells me about your experiences in developing it, and
points out any features which I might otherwise miss.  Also mention any
external library that you used, and include a link in the report to the website
where it was downloaded from.  You should also acknowledge any code which you
copied or adapted (beyond simple examples from tutorials) and any IDE or other
development tools which you used.</p>
