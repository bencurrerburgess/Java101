<h1>Assignment: Stag</h1>

<p>This assigment has zero weight.  The aims are:</p>

<ul>

<li>to practice multi-class Java programs</li>

<li>to get used to using objects as components</li>

<li>to experience a free and open-ended design space</li>

</ul>

<p>You have three options.  One is to follow the ideas below and from the Stag
lecture notes quite closely, so that you understand them better.  The second is
to do something similar, but following your own design path, taking different
decisions about what an adventure game should do and how it should be designed.
The third is to write some other program entirely which you think will help you
to practice object oriented thinking - maybe a reconstruction of a retro game
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">hangman</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">connect4</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">mastermind</a>.</p>

<p>The Stag idea is to implement a Simple Text Adventure Game.  A tiny game of
this kind might go like this, where the player types the bold text:</p>

<pre>You are stranded on a tiny desert island with a single palm tree.
You are near a tree. South is a beach. There is a spade here.
&gt; <b>go south</b>
You are on a beach. North is a tree. There is sand here.
&gt; <b>dig sand</b>
You don't have a spade.
&gt; <b>go north</b>
You are near a tree. South is a beach. There is a spade here.
&gt; <b>take spade</b>
You are carrying a spade.
&gt; <b>go south</b>
You are on a beach. North is a tree. There is sand here.
&gt; <b>dig sand</b>
You find your holiday return ticket and go home.
</pre>

<p>Thre are different design approaches you can take.</p>

<p>At one extreme in game design is the approach in the Zuul project in the
book <a href="http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/">Objects First with Java</a>.
It has a class <code>GameObject</code>, with
subclasses <code>Room</code>, <code>Item</code>, <code>Player</code>,
<code>Person</code> and so on.  Note that 'room' is a common name for any kind
of <em>place</em> in an adventure game.  This approach tends to lead to all the
complexity being in the code.  Most of the code I have seen in this style seems
to be of the old-fashioned over-verbose kind.</p>

<p>At the other extreme is my
own <a href="https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMS20805/lectures/stage.pdf">Stage</a>
approach.  There is only one game object type, <code>Entity</code>, including
places and items etc.  Different types of entity are recognised by what is
attached to them.  There is a custom scripting language with a small
interpreter.  The end result is that most of the complexity is in the data.</p>

<p>The approach in the Stag lecture notes is somewhere in the middle.  There
are enough other possibilities for everyone to produce something different.
Here are some suggestions.</p>

<h2>Overall approach</h2>

<p>Invent a small game with just one or two puzzle types, and make it your
target to implement that game.</p>

<p>Unless you are particularly interested in scripting languages and
interpreters, I suggest you fix the language (English) and have a fixed set of
verbs built into the code.  Fix the style of the game, particularly the types
of puzzles. You could, for example, have one class for each puzzle type that
you want to support.</p>

<p>On the other hand, put all the places, items, wiring, response text and
puzzle details into the data.  Aim for your code to be general enough to
support similar games in the same style just by changing the data.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Unless you have a particular personal interest in natural language
processing or simple artificial intelligence, I suggest using just plain
verb-noun commands such as:</p>

<pre>&gt; open door
</pre>

<p>It is reasonable to say that each verb has to be a single word, but a noun
can be a phrase, e.g.</p>

<pre>&gt; open red door
</pre>

<p>Instead of recognising complex commands such as "open door with key", just
arrange things so that "open door" works if the player is carrying the right
key, and not otherwise.  Somehow, the data needs to contain information about
how to solve the puzzles.</p>

<p>Depending on the style of game, it may not seem fair to make the player
guess words out of thin air.  In that case, it might be a good idea for the
player to be able to ask for all the available nouns and verbs, or all the ones
that are currently relevant</p>

<h2>Places</h2>

<p>Among other things, a place has a number of named exits to other places.  If
directions are used, then the exit names need to belong somehow to the place
you are coming from.  For example, suppose there is a place "crossroads", an
exit called "south" from the village to the crossroads, and an exit called
"north" from the town to the crossroads.  Obviously, in some sense, the word
"south" must belong to the village, and "north" to the town - there are many
directions from which to approach the crossroads.</p>

<p>An alternative, if you want the name of a place to be held in the place
itself, is to use actual place names instead of directions.  For example:</p>

<pre>You are near a tree.
You can see a spade here.
You can see a beach in the distance.
&gt; go beach
</pre>

<p>Each approach has its pros and cons.</p>

<h2>Things</h2>

<p>These games almost always have things which the player finds, carries
around, perhaps combines, and then uses to solve puzzles.</p>

<p>There are at least two ways to arrange for things to be carried around.  One
is to have an explicit player or bag object which the things being carried are
attached to.  Another is for the things being carried to be stored in the
current place, along with other things which happen to be there.  The things
being carried are distinguishable in some way and are moved from place to place
as the player moves.  An advantage of this second approach is that you never
have to look in two places for things (e.g. in the previous approach, you have
to look in one place for "take x" and in another for "drop x").</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>I suggest you start "in the middle" by writing classes which represent
places and things, then gradually widen the scope by adding control, user
interaction, a data file format, or whatever you want.</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>There are plenty of directions in which you might want to take this.  You
can use libraries, add interesting puzzle types, improve the user interface,
make the code more generic, add a saved game feature, add images, or whatever
you want.</p>

<p>Just submit the Java source files of the classes you write, and a short
report (preferably in plain text or PDF or polyglot HTML5 format).  The report
need not be long or sophisticated - it should just explain what you spent the
bulk of your time on, and what features you are most proud of.</p>

<p>The highest marks will go to those who use Java in the best way, with a
"sweet" and "simple" design, where the code has good value for money.</p>
