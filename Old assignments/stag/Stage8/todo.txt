- Keep names of things globally unique, because they might end up together
- Allow noun phrases for things, e.g. 'take red key'
- What if a thing responds to multiple verbs?
- Maybe multiple action objects could be attached to a thing
- What if the player must carry multiple things to solve a puzzle? 
- Some fields in Thing are neither final nor private
- A command "open garden" gives "what garden?" so perhaps places and
-   things sould be compatible in some way?
