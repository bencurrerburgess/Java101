<h1>Assignment: Oxo</h1>

<p>This assignment <strong>counts for 20%</strong> of the assessment for the
unit.  The main aim in this assignment is to create a multi-class program, to
practice design, classes, objects, libraries, unit testing, and style.</p>

<h2>The program</h2>

<p>The idea is to write a program called <kbd>Oxo.java</kbd> which allows two
people to play the
game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noughts_and_crosses">Noughts and
Crosses</a> (or Tic-Tac-Toe if you are American) using just text.  It would be
reasonably easy to write this program in one piece, but you are asked to
deliberately over-engineer it, as if it were a bigger project, to show off your
object oriented skills.  Here are some suggested classes:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>A <code>Board</code> class, to represent the current state of the game,
i.e. a 3x3 grid, plus which player's turn it is to move next.  It should
probably also be responsible for checking whether moves are valid or not,
whether a player has just won or not, or whether the game is a draw.  This is the main logic of the game, so this class needs unit testing.</p></li>

<li><p>A <code>Position</code> class to represent a position on the 3x3 playing
board.</p></li>

<li><p>An enumerated type class, or some other way to represent the possible
values that can appear on the board (an X, an O, or blank) in a symbolic
way.</p></li>

<li><p>A <code>Display</code> class, which deals with printing out the board as
text, and with receiving inputs from the players</p></li>

<li><p>An <code>Oxo</code> class which controls everything</p></li>

</ul>

<p>A board might be printed out like this (or something similar which indicates
row letters and column numbers):</p>

<pre>    123

a   OX.
b   ..X
c   ...
</pre>

<p>The two players might use the same keyboard to type in moves:</p>

<pre>Player O's move: <strong>b2</strong>
</pre>

<p>Some things you might like to know, and which might be helpful, are:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>You can use <code>System.out.print</code> to print out text without a
newline, e.g. as a prompt</p></li>

<li><p>You can put <code>import java.util.*;</code> at the top of your program
to import a helpful collection of utility classes, and/or <code>import
java.io.*;</code> for input/output classes</p></li>

<li><p>Either the <code>Scanner</code> or <code>Console</code> class can be
used to help with reading lines of text from the user</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Some things which I am looking for are: good design (probably along the
lines I have suggested, but in any case with "the right code in the right
place"), good style (DRY, consistent, commented but not over-commented code),
no statics (except for <code>main</code> methods), private fields (except maybe
for immutable objects), defensive programming (i.e. testing for bad things even
though they shouldn't happen, to improve debugging), unit testing (to convince
me that your classes do what they should), robustness (to convince me that your
classes don't do what they shouldn't).</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the official allowance for the assignment is only 5
hours, you have plenty to do, and doing it well will probably get you a mark in
the 60-70 range.  But if you are clever, or quick, or bored, or want extra
marks, you could try one of these extensions.  Implement an interesting variant
of the game.  Add graphics.  Add networking to play on two different computers.
Add an AI component, so a human can play against the computer.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>Just submit your <code>.java</code> files (I expect to be able to compile
them).  Add
a <code>readme.txt</code>/<code>readme.md</code>/<code>readme.pdf</code> file
if there is anything about your program which isn't immediately obvious or you
have other comments to make.  (Don't submit proprietary formats like doc, docx,
rar, but zip is OK if you need it.)</p>

<p>(<b>ZIP ON WINDOWS:</b> the built-in zip/unzip in Windows has at least two
problems.  First, it can't cope with long names. Whether this is long filenames
or long overall pathnames, I am not sure.  Second, on 'professional' versions
of Windows which support encrypted filestores, Windows uses a bit in the zip
file to indicate whether the files are encrypted or not.  Unfortunately, it is
a bit which means something different on all other systems, so zip files end up
not being portable in either direction between systems.  It is very strongly
recommended that you download and install http://www.7-zip.org/ or something
similar and use it for all zip/unzip operations.)</p>
